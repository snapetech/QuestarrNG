## Development Guidelines

```bash
# Run development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run check

# Run tests (one-shot)
npm run test:run

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Code Style

- Follow the existing TypeScript and React patterns in the codebase
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (follow the design guidelines)
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing
- Ensure `npm run check` passes without TypeScript errors

### Testing

- Add tests for new features when applicable
- Run `npm run test:run` to ensure all tests pass
- Test UI changes in both light and dark themes (currently dark-first)

#### What the tests cover

- **Unit/integration tests** (`server/__tests__/`, `client/src/__tests__/`, `client/src/lib/__tests__/`, `client/__tests__/`) run under Vitest. Server tests run in a Node environment against an in-memory SQLite database and exercise routes, storage queries, indexer/downloader clients, SSRF protections, and cron jobs directly. Client tests run in jsdom with `@testing-library/react` and cover component rendering and behavior.
- **End-to-end tests** (`tests/e2e/`) run under Playwright against a real running instance of the app (`npm run dev:test`, served on port 5100). They log in through a `setup` project that saves auth state, then exercise real user flows (pages, forms, navigation) through a browser.

#### Running tests locally

```bash
# Run the full unit/integration suite once
npm run test:run

# Watch mode while developing
npm run test:watch

# Generate a coverage report (HTML output in coverage/)
npm run test:coverage

# Run a single test file
npx vitest run server/__tests__/api_routes.test.ts

# Run tests matching a name pattern
npx vitest -t "pattern"

# E2E tests: start the test server in one terminal, then run Playwright in another
npm run dev:test
npm run test:e2e
```

`npm run dev:test` resets and seeds a dedicated test database (`data/test.db`) and starts the server on port 5100 — this must be running before `npm run test:e2e` is started, since Playwright drives the real app rather than mocks.

**Interpreting results:** Vitest prints a pass/fail count per file, with failing assertions showing expected vs. actual values and a stack trace to the failing line. Playwright prints a per-spec pass/fail list and, on failure, writes an HTML report (open with `npx playwright show-report`) containing traces and screenshots for failed steps — check the trace first, since it shows the exact point the app diverged from the expected state. A red run almost always means either a genuine regression or an environment issue (stale test DB, port already in use, missing env vars) — rule out the latter before assuming the code is wrong.

#### Running tests in CI

The `build` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main` (and can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`). For each push it runs, in order: `npm run lint`, `npm run check` (TypeScript), then the test step:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage --reporter=junit --outputFile=test-report.junit.xml
```

This runs the same Vitest suite as locally, but with coverage collection and JUnit output enabled so results can be uploaded. A separate `secrets-scan` job runs `npm run secretlint` on every push. Playwright E2E tests are **not** currently run in CI — they're a local/manual check before opening a PR.

After tests pass, CI uploads both the coverage report and the JUnit test results to Codecov (`fail_ci_if_error: true`), then proceeds to `npm run build` and a Docker image build (`docker-build` job) to confirm the app still builds and packages correctly. **Interpreting a CI failure:** check the "Tests" step logs first for the failing test name and assertion; a failure in `lint` or `check` instead means a style or type error, not a broken test — fix those before re-pushing. If the Codecov upload step fails but the tests themselves passed, that's usually a Codecov/token issue rather than a code problem.

#### Test policy for major changes

Not every change needs new tests, but treat the following as **major changes** that require adding or updating tests before merging:

- New API endpoints or changes to existing endpoint behavior (request/response shape, auth requirements, validation rules) in `server/routes.ts` — add/update a `server/__tests__/*.test.ts` file exercising the route via `supertest`.
- New or modified database schema (`shared/schema.ts`), migrations, or storage-layer queries (`server/storage.ts`) — add/update tests covering the new fields or query paths.
- New integrations or changes to existing ones (indexers, download clients, IGDB, Steam, HLTB, NexusMods, PCGamingWiki) — add/update tests, especially for error handling and any external input that touches SSRF validation.
- Security-relevant changes (auth, input validation/sanitization, SSRF checks, rate limiting) — always add a regression test that fails without the fix, and update [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](../docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) if the change adds a new external integration, trust boundary, or data flow, or materially changes an existing one.
- New cron jobs or changes to scheduled job logic (`server/cron.ts`) — add/update tests covering the job's decision logic.
- New user-facing flows or pages with meaningful interaction (forms, multi-step actions, navigation) — add a Playwright spec under `tests/e2e/`, or extend an existing one.

Changes that are typically **exempt** from new tests: pure styling/CSS tweaks, copy/wording changes, internal refactors that don't alter behavior (already covered by existing tests), and dependency bumps with no code changes. When in doubt, prefer adding a small test over skipping it — reviewers may ask for one if a major change ships without coverage.

#### Documentation policy for major changes

The same categories of "major changes" listed above (new/changed API endpoints, new integrations, security-relevant changes, new cron jobs) also require updating the relevant design/interface/security documentation before merging: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (actors and data flow), [`docs/API.md`](../docs/API.md) (external interfaces), [`docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`](../docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md) (risk register), and/or [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](../docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) (attack surface analysis).
