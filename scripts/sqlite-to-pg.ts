/**
 * Copy an existing SQLite library into a Postgres database.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SQLITE_DB_PATH=./data/sqlite.db \
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://questarr:pw@localhost:5432/questarr \
 *   npx tsx scripts/sqlite-to-pg.ts [--force] [--batch-size=500]
 *
 * Run this with Questarr STOPPED, against a Postgres database that has already
 * been migrated (`DB_DIALECT=postgres npm run db:migrate`). The target must be
 * empty unless --force is passed.
 *
 * Note this is the opposite direction to scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts, which belongs
 * to the one-time v1.1 move off Postgres. That script carries a per-table column
 * map because the schema it reads predates several renames. This one needs none:
 * both schemas are generated from the same definitions and proven structurally
 * identical by shared/schema-parity.ts, so rows can be read through Drizzle with
 * the SQLite schema and written back through Drizzle with the Postgres schema.
 * Drizzle decodes and re-encodes each column, which is what converts SQLite's
 * integer booleans, epoch-millisecond timestamps and TEXT JSON into Postgres
 * booleans, bigints and jsonb without a hand-written transform per column.
