# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

User-facing pull requests add validated fragments under [`release-notes/`](../release-notes/).
The release workflow adds those fragments to the versioned release notes and
Discord announcement while this file remains the chronological changelog.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-10-02

## [1.7.2] - 2026-10-01

### Security

- Downloader and integration requests now pin HTTPS and HTTP connections to the DNS address checked by the SSRF guard. SABnzbd no longer retries requests with certificate validation disabled; self-signed installations can trust their CA through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.
- File browser, import, SSL certificate, and screenshot paths now use canonical containment checks, including existing symlink parents and missing destination paths. Import confirmation rejects library destinations redirected outside the configured root by a symlink.
- Download-relative paths reject absolute and parent-directory components. Without an explicit path mapping, manual import overrides are restricted to the tracked download's reported directory.
- Replaced the Prowlarr and Synology string regexes that could take excessive time on crafted input, and added a development-server request limit.
- Removed npm from the production image and pinned the Python notification runtime with hashes. Updated Apprise and oauthlib to patched releases.

### Changed

- Upgraded Express to 5.2.1 and retained the existing extended query-parser behavior. TypeScript 7 remains excluded until the current typescript-eslint peer range supports it.
- Upgraded the Windows service to .NET 10 LTS and pinned its SDK and NuGet dependency lock to current servicing versions.
- Enabled automated dependency and code scanning workflows and applied compatible Dependabot updates.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Indexer HTTP 401 errors now explain when Questarr withheld an API key because the feed uses HTTP, and distinguish the Prowlarr/indexer opt-in from the downloader setting. Indexer search logs no longer retain feed API keys in request URLs. Downloader test failures now state when the HTTP opt-in did not reach the test request.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- The SeerrNG catalog endpoint can return the exact day-precision IGDB release date for a requested platform, including `null` when IGDB has no complete date.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Versioned images and installation manifests now report QuestarrNG 1.6.1 consistently. This maintenance release also removes unused release-branch triggers; application behavior is unchanged.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **RomM imports**: route matched ROM downloads into configured RomM platform folders. Import settings now include a RomM library root, transfer/conflict behavior, platform slug mappings, and manual destination selection. Existing mappings receive safe default slugs during database migration.
- **Prowlarr HTTP opt-in**: when syncing indexers from an HTTP Prowlarr instance, administrators can explicitly allow its API key to be sent to the synced HTTP indexers. New indexers remain opted out by default, and syncing with the option off preserves existing per-indexer choices.
- **Prowlarr feed diagnostics**: test the management API separately from each enabled torrent or usenet feed to identify indexer-level failures without exposing API keys or feed URLs.
- **Downloader connection checks**: the Allow insecure LAN acknowledgement is now applied to unsaved connection-test requests, so operators can test downloaders on trusted HTTP LANs as configured.
- **Proxmox install instructions**: the pinned-version example now installs QuestarrNG 1.6.0 from the maintained Snapetech repository.

### Fixed

- **File browser scope**: directory browsing is limited to configured library and download-mapping roots, and requests through symlinks that escape those roots are rejected.
- **Archive imports**: restored directory archive detection and categorized transfer handling so archive and categorized imports follow the maintained import pipeline.
- **Production startup**: the compiled server now resolves the shared game-journal schemas and starts successfully after a production build.
- **Database startup**: SQLite and PostgreSQL migrations now execute the RomM platform mapping update as separate statements, so fresh and upgraded databases can start successfully.
- **RomM import filenames**: filesystem-reserved characters now become spaces, preserving word boundaries in safe ROM destination names.
- **Screenshot uploads**: malformed image data now returns a client error instead of surfacing as a server failure.
- **Release images**: the tagged QuestarrNG image now publishes both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, matching the documented supported architectures.

### Security

- **IP address parsing dependency**: raised the `ip-address` override to `^10.7.0` (lockfile resolves 10.7.2) to include current upstream security fixes.

### Breaking changes

- Removed the unused legacy `PATCH /api/games/:id/notes` endpoint. API clients should use the per-user journal endpoints (`GET`/`POST /api/games/:id/journal` and `DELETE /api/games/:id/journal/:entryId`).

### Additional changes prepared for 1.5.0 and included in 1.6.0

The 1.5.0 release was not published. Its completed changes ship in 1.6.0:

### Removed

- **Legacy PostgreSQL migration tooling**: removed `scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts` and
  `docker-compose.migrate.yml`. The tool dated from the v1.1 move off PostgreSQL
  and only knew about 8 of the project's 19 tables, so pointing it at a current
  database would have silently skipped the rest — and it continued past
  per-table failures while still reporting `Migration completed.` Operators
  still migrating a pre-v1.1 PostgreSQL installation should use the archived
  **v1.4.2** release — see [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md), which now inlines the
  pinned compose file, links the sources by tag permalink, and spells out how to
  verify the result.

### Fixed

- **Downloader connection checks**: the insecure-LAN acknowledgement is now
  applied consistently to test-connection requests, allowing configured
  downloaders on trusted HTTP LANs to be tested without bypassing the setting.
- **Documentation**: corrected `docs/SECRETS.md` §8, which presented the
  `pg-to-sqlite` credential-logging issue as still open. It was real in
  **v1.1.0–v1.3.1**, which printed the full `DATABASE_URL` (embedding
  `user:password@host`), and was fixed in **v1.4.0** by commit `99984867`; §8
  was never updated when that landed, and its line reference had drifted onto
  the already-fixed line. §8 now states the affected range, the fix, and that
  **operators who ran the migration on an affected tag and retained the logs
  should rotate that Postgres password.**

### Security

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 5 known vulnerabilities in `fast-xml-parser`, `fast-uri`, `ip-address`, and `socket.io-parser`.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 3 additional known vulnerabilities in `qs` and `js-yaml`, restoring a clean `npm audit` after the Vulnerability Scan CI job started failing (#997).
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Fixed a critical IP-spoofing vulnerability in `proxy-addr`, flagged by Aikido Intel.

### Vulnerabilities Addressed

- **proxy-addr** (npm `overrides` pin) 2.0.7 → 2.0.8 — fixes **CVE-2026-90711** ([AIKIDO-2026-101201](https://security.aikido.dev/cve/AIKIDO-2026-101201), CRITICAL) — an undersized IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust-subnet prefix (e.g. `::ffff:10.0.0.0/8` instead of `::ffff:10.0.0.0/104`) was accepted without error but trusted every IPv4 address on the internet, letting unauthenticated clients spoof `X-Forwarded-For` and bypass IP-based access controls, rate limiting, and audit logging, vulnerable range `>=1.1.0 <=2.0.7`. Reaches production via `express`, which pins `proxy-addr: ~2.0.7` (a range that otherwise excludes the fix).
- **fast-xml-parser** 5.10.0 → 5.10.1 — fixes GHSA-8r6m-32jq-jx6q (no CVE assigned, HIGH) — a parsing issue in the 5.9.3–5.10.0 range fixed in 5.10.1.
- **fast-uri** (npm `overrides` pin, dev-only via `secretlint` → `ajv`) 3.1.3 → 3.1.4 → 3.1.5 — the 3.1.4 → 3.1.5 bump fixes GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7 (HIGH) — host confusion via backslash authority introducer, vulnerable range `3.0.0 - 3.1.4`.
- **ip-address** (transitive via `express-rate-limit` and `socks`) 10.2.0 → 10.4.0 — fixes GHSA-mwp4-54f8-5fhr (HIGH, SSRF/trust-boundary bypass via octal-decoded leading-zero octets), plus two moderate SSRF-adjacent advisories (GHSA-4xrf-jv44-h6hh, GHSA-22jq-vg5j-6vgg) already covered by the same bump. No `overrides` pin needed — `express-rate-limit`'s `^10.2.0` and `socks`'s `^10.1.1` ranges already permit 10.4.0.
- **socket.io-parser** (npm `overrides` pin) 4.2.6 → 4.2.7 — fixes GHSA-2m8v-j782-fhvr (HIGH, CVSS 7.5) — zero-attachment memory exhaustion, vulnerable range `4.0.0 - <4.2.7`. Reaches production via `socket.io`/`socket.io-client` (real-time download-progress and notification updates).
- **qs** (npm `overrides` pin) 6.15.2 → 6.16.0 — fixes GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g (MODERATE) — DoS via attacker-controlled `isBuffer`, vulnerable range `>=2.2.5 <6.16.0` — and GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx (MODERATE) — array-limit bypass via bracket-key comma parsing, vulnerable range `>=6.14.2 <=6.15.3`. Reaches production via `express`/`body-parser`, both of which pin `qs: ~6.15.1` (a range that otherwise excludes the fix); the same override also closes the gap in `openid`, `steam-web`, and `superagent` (#997).
- **js-yaml** (npm `overrides` pin, dev-only, scoped to `@eslint/eslintrc`) 4.3.0 → 4.3.2 — fixes GHSA-5p4m-2wfm-xmqj (HIGH) — quadratic CPU consumption in `!!omap` resolution. Scoped rather than global so the already-unaffected top-level `js-yaml@5.3.0` is left untouched (#997).

### Changed

- Dependency updates: `undici` 7.29.0 → 8.9.0 (direct dependency, used by the SSRF-safe fetch wrapper in `server/ssrf.ts`). No vulnerability fix — see `docs/CVE_FIXES_BY_RELEASE.md` for verification. Major version bump; undici 8.9.0 requires Node `>=22.19.0`, so Questarr's own `engines.node` floor is raised from `>=20` to `>=22.19.0` to match — this only formalizes existing practice, since CI (`node-version: 26.x`) and the production Docker image (`node:26-alpine`) were already on Node 26. Full test suite and `server/__tests__/ssrf.test.ts` verified green against the new version.

- **QuestarrNG releases**: version checks and release links now follow the
  Snapetech fork. Releases publish versioned images under
  `ghcr.io/snapetech/questarrng`; `latest` continues to track the fork's main
  build.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-11

Hotfix release, tagged directly off `v1.4.1` rather than from `main` — not part of this branch's history. Fixed the same `ip-address` and `socket.io-parser` advisories independently patched above for `main`'s own accumulated changes (see the `[1.5.0]` entry). Full details in the `v1.4.2` tag and its own copy of this file.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-02

Hotfix release addressing dependency vulnerabilities flagged by `npm audit`.

### Security

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 3 known vulnerabilities in `brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, and `body-parser`, plus a second, devDependency-only resolution path for the same `brace-expansion` advisory.

### Vulnerabilities Addressed

- **brace-expansion** 5.0.7 → 5.0.8 — fixes **CVE-2026-14257** (GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg, HIGH) — DoS via unbounded expansion length causing an out-of-memory process crash.
- **js-yaml** 5.2.1 → 5.2.2 — fixes GHSA-pm4m-ph32-ghv5 (no CVE assigned, HIGH) — exponential parsing time in flow collections leading to denial of service.
- **body-parser** 1.20.5 → 1.20.6 — fixes **CVE-2026-12590** (GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6, LOW) — an invalid `limit` value silently disabled size enforcement, allowing arbitrarily large request payloads.
- **minimatch** override pinned to `^10.2.5` — closes a second resolution path for **CVE-2026-14257** (GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg, HIGH): `eslint-plugin-react`'s bundled `minimatch@3.1.5` still pulled the vulnerable `brace-expansion@1.1.16`. devDependency-only (not shipped in the production image), but flagged by `npm audit` without `--omit=dev`, so pinned for a fully clean audit.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-16

Migration note:

- The `PORT` variable in `docker-compose.yml` has been split into two: `HOST_SIDE_PORT` (host-side binding, default `5000`) and `CONTAINER_INTERNAL_SIDE_PORT` (internal container port, default `5000`). If you had `PORT` set in your `.env` to customize the host port, rename it to `HOST_SIDE_PORT`.
- With Post-processing, don't forget to add your volume mapping to the docker compose file.

An easter egg has been added to the app; shouldn't be too hard to find if you think about the very famous easter eggs in gaming! Let me know what you think.

### Added

- **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Added an automated post-processing pipeline that handles unpacking and organizing files after a download completes (#583)
  - Files can be unpacked automatically by setting auto-unpack setting
  - An import modal is displayed via an alert in the library when the system cannot find the input or output path.
- **Import History**: New page listing import tasks (game claims, post-processing imports, Steam syncs) with a retention purge cron job to keep the history tidy (#714).
- **Deluge Support**: Added Deluge as a supported downloader (#697).
- **Synology Download Station**: Added support for Synology's built-in Download Station as a downloader (#567).
- **Apprise Notifications**: Added Apprise API and CLI notification modes. Use API mode with a remote Apprise server or CLI mode with the local `apprise` binary from Questarr settings. Bundled Python and Apprise in the default image so CLI mode works without a separate image split.
- **Personal Notes**: Added the ability to attach personal notes to a game.
- **Shelved Status**: Added a "shelved" status for games (#645).
- **Real-Time Logs**: Added a real-time log streaming page with configurable detail level and truncation for large payloads.
- **Send Logs**: Added the ability to send logs directly from the app for troubleshooting (#648).
- **Search Improvements**: Added a date filter and infinite scroll to search, plus the ability to delete a result from the library directly from search (#673).
- **Library Ratings**: Added a user rating filter and inline rating in the library's list view; the Stats page now shows average user rating.
- **Favorite groups**: Added favorite release groups for auto downloading releases, in the settings.
- **G4U as indexer**: Added g4u.to as an indexer type, using their VIP API (#689).
- **Vite Base Path**: Added support for deploying behind a custom base path (#630).
- **Code of Conduct**: Added Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.
- **Downloaders Compatibility doc**: Added a document detailing compatibility for supported downloaders.

### Security

- **SSRF**: Hardened outbound fetches with DNS rebinding protection (#698).
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Fixed 3 known vulnerabilities in `esbuild`, `form-data`, and `ws` (#734).
- **CI Hardening**: Applied StepSecurity best practices, added a blocking Semgrep SAST gate and secretlint scanning, and added automatic SBOM generation to the Docker release pipeline.
- **OpenSSF**: passed baseline 1, 2 and 3 security self-eval (ongoing for 'passing' check). Update to current checks and new ones for hardened security. New policies. See SECURITY.md on GitHub.

### Changed

- **Dashboard**: Consolidated the Dashboard into the Library component, removing the separate Library page.
- **Docker**:
  - Refactoring of the entrypoint script.
  - `SQLITE_DB_PATH` is now optional and exported with a default of `/app/data/sqlite.db`.
  - The `PORT` variable in `docker-compose.yml` has been split into two: `HOST_SIDE_PORT` (host-side binding, default `5000`) and `CONTAINER_INTERNAL_SIDE_PORT` (internal container port, default `5000`). If you had `PORT` set in your `.env` to customize the host port, rename it to `HOST_SIDE_PORT`.
- **Dependencies**: Node 22 to 26. Removed duplicate `@types/multer` entry from `package.json`; updated Radix UI, semver, and other minor dependencies; upgraded `codecov/codecov-action` from v5 to v7; updated numerous packages via Dependabot including `lucide-react`, `recharts`, `framer-motion`, `jsdom`, `express`, `express-rate-limit`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-hook-form`, and GitHub Actions.
- **Performance**: Optimized the Add Game modal's collection-status check with a Set lookup (#677); the downloads page now polls every 30 seconds.
- **Downloaders Module**: Refactored `downloaders.ts` into smaller modules for easier maintenance (#627).
- **Notifications Behaviour**: the notifications now trigger only once per event, instead of once per cron job.
- **Genres & Platforms Display**: Overflow-safe tag list for genres and platforms on game cards (#680).
- **Aborted Downloads**: Definitive downloader failures are now surfaced as "Aborted" instead of an unclear stuck state.
- **List View**: Removed the ultra-compact view in favor of an updated column-based row view.
- **Date display**: year-only release dates now display in full.
- **Release Date Sorting when adding a game**: IGDB results are not sorted by release date.
- **Mobile Experience**: Significant improvements to mobile layout and navigation (#644).
- **Downloader/Indexer Version Logging**: Periodic logging of downloader and indexer versions to aid troubleshooting (#649).

### Removed

- Fixed handling of the `stoppedDL` state in qBittorrent v5+.
- Fixed an error when adding a torrent via qBittorrent.
- Fixed a scrolling issue in the claim modal.
- Fixed Torznab/Prowlarr download URL rewriting so proxied URLs are no longer double-wrapped on host aliases (#647).
- Fixed the files view and missing seed/leech numbers in download details.
- Hardened download status checks and migrated the Steam logger.
- Addressed edge cases in auto-search download rules
- Fixed the "Has results" badge that would create an offset in the game card.
- Fixed the Home Assistant add-on: moved to the repo root and corrected /data permissions on fresh installs (#696). See [../questarr/README.md]

### Vulnerabilities Addressed

- **js-yaml** 4.1.1 → 5.2.1 — fixes **CVE-2026-53550** (GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68, MODERATE) — quadratic-complexity DoS in merge-key handling via repeated aliases.
- **multer** 2.1.1 → 2.2.0 — fixes the 2 CVEs left open in the v1.3.0
  - **CVE-2026-5038** (GHSA-3p4h-7m6x-2hcm, MODERATE) — DoS via incomplete cleanup of aborted uploads
  - **CVE-2026-5079** (GHSA-72gw-mp4g-v24j, HIGH) — DoS via deeply nested field names
- **form-data** (transitive, resolved 4.0.5 → 4.0.6) — fixes **CVE-2026-12143** (GHSA-hmw2-7cc7-3qxx, HIGH) — CRLF injection via unescaped multipart field names/filenames.
- **ws** (transitive, resolved 8.18.3 → 8.21.0) — fixes 2 CVEs:
  - **CVE-2026-45736** (GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx, MODERATE) — uninitialized memory disclosure
  - **CVE-2026-48779** (GHSA-96hv-2xvq-fx4p, HIGH) — memory exhaustion DoS from tiny fragments/data chunks
- **esbuild** (devDep) 0.28.0 → 0.28.1 — fixes GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr (no CVE assigned) — the Windows dev-server arbitrary-file-read issue flagged as still-open in the v1.2.1/v1.3.0 entries is now fixed.
- **esbuild, nested copy** — the new npm `overrides` entry (`@esbuild-kit/core-utils` → `esbuild ^0.25.0`) bumps that dependency's bundled esbuild from 0.18.20 to 0.25.12, fixing GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 (no CVE, MODERATE — dev server accepts arbitrary cross-origin requests). Separately, `tsx`'s own duplicate nested esbuild copy (0.27.7, carrying the same GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr as above) was deduped away entirely by this bump round rather than upgraded.
- **vite** (devDep) 8.0.12 → 8.1.3 — fixes both issues left open in the v1.3.0:
  - **CVE-2026-53571** (GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff) — `server.fs.deny` bypass
  - **CVE-2026-53632** (GHSA-v6wh-96g9-6wx3) — launch-editor NTLMv2 hash disclosure via UNC path on Windows

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Fix broken indexer URLs when fetching NZBs through clients that relay the request
- Fix auto-search download rules handling.
- Fix CRLF line endings in Docker entrypoint script to prevent container start failures on Linux hosts.

### Changed

- Improve rTorrent error message when Digest authentication fails.
- Added retry algo before marking a download as failed, reducing false-positive failures.
- Optimize dashboard statistics computation for faster page load.
