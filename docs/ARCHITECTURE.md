# System Architecture & Actors

This document describes Questarr's system design: the actors (subsystems and
external entities that can influence one another) and the data flows between
them. It complements [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), which covers code-level
conventions rather than system design, and [`docs/API.md`](API.md) /
[`docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`](SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md), which cover the
external interface and risk-assessment angles of the same system.

**Update policy:** update this document whenever a PR introduces a new actor
(a new external integration, download client, or background job) or changes
how data flows between existing actors.

## 1. Overview

Questarr is a three-layer TypeScript application in a single `package.json`
(not a monorepo):

- **`/client`** — a React 18 single-page app (Wouter routing, TanStack Query
  for server state).
- **`/server`** — an Express REST API plus a Socket.io WebSocket channel.
- **`/shared`** — the Drizzle ORM schema and Zod validation schemas used by
  both sides.

The client never talks to the database, external services, or download
clients directly — every action is mediated by the server, which is the
system's central trust boundary (§8).

## 2. System actors

An "actor" here is any subsystem or entity that can influence another part
of the system — by writing data, triggering a request, or emitting an event.

## 4. Example flow: search, select a release, download

    actor U as User
    participant C as Client
    participant R as routes.ts
    participant S as search.ts
    participant I as Torznab/Newznab Indexers
    participant D as DownloaderManager
    participant DB as SQLite

    U->>C: Click "Search" on a game
    C->>R: GET /api/indexers/search (JWT)
    R->>S: searchAllIndexers()
    S->>I: fan out parallel queries (via safeFetch)
    I-->>S: release metadata
    S-->>R: normalized/merged/sorted results
    R-->>C: results list
    U->>C: Select a release to download
    C->>R: POST /api/downloaders/:id/downloads
    R->>D: addDownload()
    D->>I: fetch magnet/NZB link (via safeFetch)
    R->>DB: persist game_downloads record
    Note over R,DB: cron.ts::checkDownloadStatus polls the downloader every minute and emits downloadUpdate over Socket.io on status change
```

## 5. Request/response flow

Every REST call follows the same path: **Client → routes (`server/routes.ts`
et al., validated via `express-validator`/Zod) → `storage.ts` (Drizzle ORM
queries against `shared/schema.ts`) → JSON response.** Routes never touch
the database directly — all reads/writes go through `storage.ts`, which is
the only module importing the Drizzle `db` client for application data.

## 6. Out-of-band channel: Socket.io

`server/socket.ts` gates every connection with an `io.use` handshake check
(`server/socket.ts:29-44`): the socket must carry the auth cookie (from a
trusted Origin) or a bearer token that `verifyAuthToken` accepts, otherwise
the handshake is rejected with "Authentication required". Once connected,
`notifyUser(type, payload)` (`server/socket.ts:143-147`) calls
`io.emit(type, payload)` — a broadcast to every authenticated socket, with
no per-user rooms (a `TODO` in `cron.ts` flags this — see
`server/cron.ts:978,1045`; tracked in #1081). This is consistent with §9:
Questarr's supported deployment is one trusted operator per instance, so a
cross-account broadcast is not a hardened boundary today and isn't being
prioritized as one. Two event types are emitted today:

- `"notification"` — emitted from both `cron.ts` (game updates, download
  completion, auto-search results, xREL matches) and `routes.ts`; consumed by
  `client/src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx`.
- `"downloadUpdate"` — emitted from `cron.ts::checkDownloadStatus` whenever a
  tracked download's status changes; consumed by
  `client/src/components/GameDetailsModal.tsx` to refresh download state for
  the affected game.

## 7. Scheduled/background actors (cron jobs)

`server/cron.ts::startCronJobs()` schedules seven recurring `setInterval`
jobs. The five primary sync/check jobs below also run once on an initial
10-second delayed startup; `startCronJobs()` additionally runs
`logClientVersions` (every 12 hours, probes configured indexer/downloader
client versions for logging) and a daily import-task cleanup (deletes
`import_tasks` rows older than 30 days), neither of which reads/writes
domain data covered by this table:

| Job                   | Interval                                                                                  | Upstream read                                                                           | Downstream write                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkGameUpdates`    | 24 hours                                                                                  | IGDB (batch fetch by ID)                                                                | `games` table (release date/status), `notifications` table, Socket.io `notification`                             |
| `checkDownloadStatus` | 1 minute                                                                                  | Configured download clients (via `DownloaderManager`)                                   | `game_downloads`/`games` status, `notifications`, Socket.io `downloadUpdate`/`notification`                      |
| `checkAutoSearch`     | 1 hour (per user, gated by their configured search interval)                              | Torznab/Newznab indexers (via `search.ts`), download clients (if auto-download enabled) | `games` search-results flag, `game_downloads`, `notifications`, Socket.io `notification`                         |
| `checkXrelReleases`   | 6 hours                                                                                   | xREL.to latest releases                                                                 | `xrel_notified_releases`, `notifications`, Socket.io `notification`                                              |
| `checkSteamWishlist`  | 1 hour (per user, gated by their configured sync interval, opt-in via `steamSyncEnabled`) | Steam Web API wishlist, IGDB (Steam App ID lookup)                                      | `games` table (new/linked entries), `import_tasks`, `notifications`, Socket.io `importTaskUpdate`/`notification` |

Steam wishlist sync (`syncUserSteamWishlist` in `server/cron.ts`) also runs
on-demand when a user explicitly triggers it via
`POST /api/steam/wishlist/sync` (`server/steam-routes.ts:37-56`). The
scheduled path is opt-in per user (`userSettings.steamSyncEnabled`, default
`false`) with a configurable interval (`userSettings.steamSyncIntervalHours`,
default 24) tracked via `userSettings.lastSteamSync`.

## 8. Trust boundaries

- **Browser ↔ Server** is the primary trust boundary. The client is treated
  as fully untrusted; every write path is re-validated server-side
  (`express-validator`/Zod) regardless of client-side checks, and all
  non-public routes require a valid JWT (`authenticateToken`,
  `server/auth.ts:104-126`).
- **Server ↔ third-party services** is a secondary boundary, mediated by
  `server/ssrf.ts::safeFetch` for outbound calls whose target host is wholly
  or partly user-supplied (indexers, download clients, HowLongToBeat,
  NexusMods, Steam, PCGamingWiki). `safeFetch` blocks link-local/cloud-
  metadata/broadcast ranges unconditionally, and re-validates every resolved
  IP to guard against DNS rebinding (`server/ssrf.ts:4-18,181-249`).
  `allowPrivate` defaults to `true` (`server/ssrf.ts:19-22,86`), i.e. private/
  loopback ranges are reachable by design — Questarr is meant to be
  self-hosted alongside indexers/downloaders that often live on the same
  LAN.
- `server/igdb.ts` also routes its Twitch/IGDB requests through `safeFetch`,
  consistent with every other integration, even though the target host
  (`api.igdb.com`/`id.twitch.tv`) is hardcoded rather than user-supplied —
  applied as defense in depth rather than out of SSRF necessity.

See [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) for a more detailed attack-surface
analysis of these trust boundaries (per-integration trust table, high-risk
data flows, and the unauthenticated-route inventory).

## 9. Multi-user status

**Questarr is not, and is not planned to become, a multi-user application
for the foreseeable future.** The supported deployment is one trusted
operator per instance (see [`docs/PRD.md`](PRD.md) §6 Non-Goals and §8
Technical Constraints, and [`../GOAL-product.md`](../GOAL-product.md)).

The schema and auth layer nonetheless have partial multi-account
_plumbing_, which predates this decision and should not be read as a
roadmap signal: a `users` table exists, `authenticateToken` resolves a
per-request `req.user.id` from a JWT, and personal-library tables
(`games`, `user_settings`, `notifications`, `import_tasks`, `api_keys`,
`release_blacklist`) carry a `userId` column. Instance-wide config and
shared runtime state — `indexers`, `downloaders`, `root_folders`,
`rss_feeds`, `game_downloads` — deliberately carry **no** `userId`, since
they represent one server's shared configuration, not per-account data.

Because of this, account isolation is inconsistent by design, not a defect
to eliminate wholesale:

- Some code paths do scope by `userId` (e.g. `resolveOwnedGame` in
  `routes.ts`, and the igdbId-reuse checks before reusing an existing game
  record), because getting those specific paths right also happens to be
  good practice regardless of user count.
- Others intentionally don't: `notifyUser()` broadcasts Socket.io events to
  every connected client (§6); `library-scanner.ts`'s scan state
  (`getAllUnmatched`, `getAllScanProgress`) is global, matching `root_folders`
  being global; download clients and indexers are shared instance
  configuration, not per-user.
- The trust model is flat with no RBAC/admin split (see
  [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) §8, "Flat, single-tier trust
  model" — accepted risk).

**For review purposes:** a finding that one authenticated account can read
or influence another account's data on the same instance is not, by
itself, a release-blocking vulnerability under this deployment model —
Questarr has exactly one intended operator per instance. It's still fine
to close such a gap opportunistically when already touching that code
(consistency and defense-in-depth have value even here), but it should not
be treated as urgent, and should not be used to justify widening a PR's
scope. If the multi-user goalposts ever move, that will be a deliberate,
separately-scoped product decision — not something to infer from the
partial `userId` scoping already present in the schema.
