# What changed in QuestarrNG

QuestarrNG is Snapetech's maintained fork of
[Doezer/Questarr](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr). This guide summarizes
the main product and maintenance additions made for the fork. The
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) remains the complete versioned record, including
individual fixes and security updates.

The Snapetech fork was created in September 2026. The v1.5.0 release was not
published; its completed work shipped in v1.6.0. Fork releases from v1.6.0
through [v1.9.0](https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG/releases/tag/v1.9.0)
added the capabilities below.

## Product capabilities

### Library and discovery

- Platform preferences now scope discovery, library filtering, adding games,
  download searches, and import eligibility. Users can hide owned or shelved
  titles by default and scan platform-specific local roots to reconcile files.
- The **Playing** workflow records personal journal entries, milestones,
  screenshots, and Steam achievements. Game details include DLC and expansion
  entries, and discovery can use the exact release date for a selected IGDB
  platform.
- A global release-name blacklist applies across manual search, automatic
  search, and AI-assisted release selection. Existing genre, year, platform,
  and content filters continue to apply to discovery results.

### Acquisition, import, and safety

- Post-processing moves or copies completed downloads into configured library
  locations and handles archive extraction. RomM imports can be mapped to
  RomM's platform folders with configurable transfer and conflict behavior.
- Prowlarr feed diagnostics test each enabled torrent or usenet indexer
  separately. HTTP Prowlarr/API-key forwarding is opt-in, and indexer/download
  diagnostics explain when credentials are withheld for an insecure transport.
- Archive imports reject traversal and link entries and enforce configured
  entry-count and expanded-size limits. Optional VirusTotal hash lookups and
  local ClamAV scans can quarantine flagged files before they enter the library.
  See the [import setup and scanning guide](IMPORTS.md) for operator steps and
  scanner behavior.

### Integrations

- **Playnite:** the extension can synchronize the local library, promote
  installed games to owned, and submit a request that enters Questarr's normal
  search and download workflow. See the
  [Playnite extension guide](../extensions/playnite-questarr/README.md).
- **RomM:** matched ROM downloads can be routed to mapped RomM platform folders.
- **SeerrNG:** the versioned provider API supplies an IGDB catalog and
  request-scoped PC-game acquisition. It carries an external request ID and
  selected operating system/architecture through search and download, reports
  lifecycle status, and exposes imported files through authenticated,
  request-scoped streaming. See the
  [integration guide](SEERRNG-INTEGRATION.md),
  [API reference](API.md#integration-api-external-clients), and
  [OpenAPI contract](contracts/seerrng-v1.openapi.yaml).

### Deployment and operations

- SQLite remains the zero-configuration default; PostgreSQL is available as an
  optional backend. See [database setup](DATABASE.md).
- The maintained release image is published for `linux/amd64` and
  `linux/arm64`. QuestarrNG also maintains a self-contained .NET 10 Windows
  service host, a Helm chart, and home-server installation definitions.
- Compose and Helm can run the service as a non-root user with a read-only
  root filesystem and dropped Linux capabilities. Published images include
  SBOM and provenance attestations. See the
  [security overview](THREAT_MODEL.md),
  [Proxmox guide](PROXMOX.md), and
  [home-server app guides](HOME_SERVER_APPS.md).
- Releases use curated user-facing notes; dependency and code scanning are
  part of the maintained release process. See the
  [security policy](../.github/SECURITY.md) and
  [release-note guide](../release-notes/README.md).

## Current SeerrNG provider compatibility

QuestarrNG 1.9.0 advertises SeerrNG `apiVersion: 1` and
`requestContractVersion: 1`. It supports the IGDB catalog, PC acquisition,
request retry/cancel, and imported-file streaming. The handshake reports
emulation acquisition as unsupported; the request asset-list response reports
`bundleSupported: false`.

SeerrNG's v3.51.0 release adds PC play-time and multi-file download behavior
that requests provider contract version 2. Until QuestarrNG implements and
advertises that version, consumers should treat those v2-specific capabilities
as unavailable. See the
[SeerrNG release note](https://github.com/snapetech/seerrng/blob/main/release-notes/questarr-catalog-estimates-and-bundles.md)
and the current [QuestarrNG provider contract](contracts/seerrng-v1.openapi.yaml).
