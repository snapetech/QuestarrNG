## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document is QuestarrNG's attack-surface analysis, satisfying [OpenSSF Baseline
OSPS-SA-03.02](https://baseline.openssf.org/): it identifies critical code paths, trust
boundaries, and external interactions, and records how each threat is mitigated or
knowingly accepted.

**In scope:** the Express API and its route handlers, the React client, the SQLite/Postgres
Drizzle data layer, Socket.io realtime channel, SeerrNG provider API, downloaded archive
contents, PC and RomM library folders, optional VirusTotal and ClamAV scanning, and every
external service QuestarrNG talks to (indexers, download clients, IGDB, Steam,
HowLongToBeat, NexusMods, xREL, PCGamingWiki).

**Out of scope:** OS/host hardening, reverse proxy/TLS termination, and Docker deployment
configuration — those are covered by [`.github/SECURITY.md`](../.github/SECURITY.md)'s
deployment security guide.

**Maintenance rule:** update this document whenever a change adds a new external
integration, a new trust boundary, a new unauthenticated route, or materially changes
authentication/authorization behavior. This is enforced as part of the security-relevant
test policy in [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Bump the "Last
reviewed" date above whenever this document is revisited, even if no changes are needed —
a stale date is the signal that a review is overdue.

Six named trust boundaries:

1. **Browser ↔ Server** — JWT bearer auth (`server/auth.ts`). Once authenticated, a user has
   full access to their own resources; there is no admin/non-admin split (see Section 8,
   "flat trust model" — an accepted design tradeoff, not a gap).
2. **Server ↔ SQLite/Postgres** — fully trusted; all access is parameterized via Drizzle ORM.
3. **Server ↔ user-configured external hosts** (indexers, download clients, RSS feeds) —
   **the highest-risk boundary**. A user (or a compromised/malicious indexer response) can
   point the server at an arbitrary host, including internal LAN services. This is the
   primary reason `server/ssrf.ts` exists.
4. **Server ↔ hardcoded external APIs** (IGDB, Steam, HLTB, NexusMods, xREL, PCGamingWiki) —
   lower risk since hosts aren't user-supplied, but responses are still untrusted data, and
   `safeFetch`/`isSafeUrl` is applied as defense in depth regardless.
5. **SeerrNG ↔ provider API** — the caller is a separate trusted self-hosted service, but
   request IDs, titles, and variants are untrusted input. A dedicated API key can be limited
   to the versioned SeerrNG routes and expires by default; every operation is scoped to the
   QuestarrNG account that owns the key.
6. **Downloaded archive ↔ filesystem** — release archives are untrusted even when fetched
   through an administrator-configured indexer. Before extraction, QuestarrNG checks listed
   paths, links, declared expanded size, and total entry count; extraction also has a 30-minute
   process timeout and bounded listing output.
7. **Server ↔ optional scanners** — VirusTotal receives only a SHA-256 hash over HTTPS; the
   configured API key stays server-side. ClamAV receives scanned file contents over its
   INSTREAM TCP protocol at a DNS-validated address. That connection is not encrypted, so
   operators should keep the configured daemon on a trusted network.

---

## 3. Assets

- **Credentials:** user password hashes, the JWT signing secret, indexer API keys,
  download-client passwords, NexusMods and VirusTotal API keys. See
  [`docs/SECRETS.md`](./SECRETS.md) for the authoritative inventory of where each of these
  lives and how it's protected.
- **Library/download metadata:** game collections, download history — low sensitivity, but
  cross-user leakage is a privacy concern (see Socket.io note in Section 8).
- **Server availability:** self-hosted, typically on a home server/NAS — denial of service
  matters more here than in a scaled cloud deployment.
- **The host LAN:** the top SSRF concern. Download clients are frequently on the same
  network as other unauthenticated home-lab services; inducing the server to make requests
  to arbitrary internal hosts is the most damaging class of attack against this app.

## 4. High-Risk Data Flows

### 4.1 Indexer search → download client

Search query → indexer (Torznab/Newznab/Prowlarr, user-configured URL) → parsed result
(payload URLs from the indexer's response, untrusted) → `isSafeUrl()` check → `safeFetch()`
to retrieve the `.torrent`/`.nzb` payload → handed to the download client.

Mitigations:

- `server/ssrf.ts` `isSafeUrl()`/`safeFetch()` — DNS-rebinding-safe resolution (validates
  every resolved IP, not just the first), blocks cloud metadata ranges.
- `server/downloaders.ts:333,970,1893,3439,4057` — `isSafeUrl()` gate before fetching a
  release's payload URL; `:3447,4063` — `safeFetch()` for the actual NZB fetch.
- `server/torznab.ts:69,446` and `server/newznab.ts:53,114,311,320,373,382` — indexer
  clients gate search-result URLs the same way before fetching.
- `server/middleware.ts:300,373,427` — `sanitizeDownloaderData`/`sanitizeIndexerData` block
  `..` in user-supplied download paths at write time (see residual risk in Section 8).
- `server/downloaders/utils.ts:buildRemoteImportPath` rejects absolute and parent-directory
  components in downloader-reported relative paths before joining them. Manual import path
  overrides without explicit path mappings must remain inside the tracked download directory.

Note: raw `fetch()`/RPC calls inside `downloaders.ts` that target the **admin-configured
download client itself** (e.g. the Transmission/qBittorrent control API) are not SSRF-gated,
and don't need to be — that host is the trust anchor the admin explicitly configured, not
attacker-influenced data. Only fetches of indexer-supplied _payload_ URLs are the SSRF
concern, and those are covered above.

### 4.2 IGDB metadata fetch

Server → `id.twitch.tv` (OAuth token) → `api.igdb.com` (game metadata). Both hosts are
hardcoded; credentials come from `system_config`/env (`server/config.ts`).

Mitigations: `igdbRateLimiter` (per-user configurable); `sanitizeSearchQuery`/`sanitizeIgdbId`
in `server/middleware.ts`; as of this document's revision, both calls in `server/igdb.ts`
route through `safeFetch()` (previously used raw `fetch()`, inconsistent with every other
integration — fixed alongside this document, see Section 8).

### 4.3 User-configured RSS / indexer / downloader URLs

A user enters an arbitrary host (RSS feed URL, custom indexer, custom downloader address) at
setup/settings time → stored in SQLite → later fetched by `server/cron.ts`/`server/rss.ts`/the
relevant client.

Mitigations: `sanitizeIndexerData`/`sanitizeDownloaderData` validate at write time; every
fetch re-validates via `isSafeUrl()`/`safeFetch()` at _use_ time too, not just at save time —
this matters because DNS can change between when a URL is saved and when it's next fetched
(classic TOCTOU/rebinding window).

### 4.4 Downloaded archive → library filesystem

Indexer/download client output → metadata listing and bounded preflight validation → archive
integrity check → 7-Zip or unrar extraction into the import destination.

Mitigations in `server/services/ArchiveService.ts` reject absolute and parent-traversal
paths, symbolic/hard links, paths deeper than 64 components, more than 50,000 archive entries,
and declared expansion beyond 250 GiB by default. Operators can lower or raise the byte/entry
limits with `ARCHIVE_MAX_EXPANDED_BYTES` and `ARCHIVE_MAX_ENTRIES`. Archive tool output is
capped at 10 MiB and each tool invocation times out after 30 minutes. These metadata
preflight limits reduce path escape and decompression-bomb risk, but do not impose an OS
filesystem quota if an archive lies about its declared sizes.

### 4.5 Optional pre-import security scan

When enabled, `SecurityScanService` checks a completed download before it is imported:

- **VirusTotal** computes a SHA-256 digest of the primary file and queries the fixed HTTPS
  API endpoint. The file itself is not sent. Detection threshold and whether an unknown hash
  blocks import are configurable.
- **ClamAV** streams files through the configured daemon's INSTREAM protocol. The configured
  hostname is resolved and validated before QuestarrNG connects; file contents cross that TCP
  connection, so deploy the daemon on a trusted network.
- A detection moves the download to a sibling `.questarr-quarantine` directory, marks it
  `quarantined`, and creates a Security Alert. The normal import-review flow rejects
  quarantined downloads.
- Scanner network and time-out errors fail open and allow processing to continue. A partially
  enumerated or truncated ClamAV directory scan blocks import rather than claiming it was
  clean. VirusTotal can also block unknown hashes when that option is enabled.

Scanning is optional defense in depth, not a guarantee that every file is safe. It should not
replace operator review or host-level endpoint protection.

## 6. Existing Mitigations Index

This section cross-references controls by category rather than duplicating them — treat the
linked file as the source of truth.

- **SSRF / DNS rebinding:** `server/ssrf.ts` (`isSafeUrl`, `safeFetch`)
- **Input sanitization:** `server/middleware.ts` (`sanitizeSearchQuery`, `sanitizeGameId`,
  `sanitizeDownloadId`, `sanitizeIgdbId`, `sanitizeGameData`, `sanitizeIndexerData`,
  `sanitizeDownloaderData`, `sanitizeIndexerSearchQuery`)
- **Rate limiting:** `server/middleware.ts` (`igdbRateLimiter`, `authRateLimiter`,
  `sensitiveEndpointLimiter`, `generalApiLimiter`, `scanRateLimiter`,
  `integrationRateLimiter`); `server/index.ts:34` (global mount)
- **Authentication/session:** `server/auth.ts` (JWT issuance/verification); global gate at
  `server/routes.ts:845`
- **SeerrNG provider authorization:** `server/auth.ts` (key scope and expiry),
  `server/routes/integration.ts` (request/asset ownership and path containment)
- **Archive extraction:** `server/services/ArchiveService.ts` (path/link/count/size preflight,
  process timeout and bounded child-process output)
- **Pre-import scanning and quarantine:** `server/security-scan.ts`,
  `server/services/ImportManager.ts` (optional hash reputation and ClamAV scan; detections
  block import and move the download to quarantine)
- **SQL injection:** not applicable by construction — Drizzle ORM parameterizes all
  application queries; the only raw SQL (`sql.raw`/`sql` template literals in
  `server/migrate.ts`) is hardcoded migration DDL with no user input.
- **Secrets encryption at rest:** `server/credential-crypto.ts` (AES-256-GCM) — indexer API
  keys and downloader username/passwords; see [`docs/SECRETS.md`](./SECRETS.md) §4 for the
  full mechanism (key resolution, legacy-plaintext-row handling, masked-sentinel rotation)
- **Secrets scanning / dependency hygiene:** GitHub secret scanning and push protection,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`secretlint`), `.github/dependabot.yml`, and
  `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`
- **SAST:** CodeQL advanced setup in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (JavaScript/TypeScript,
  C#, and GitHub Actions) plus Semgrep in `.github/workflows/sast.yml`
- **Container image scanning:** Trivy in `.github/workflows/vulnerability-scan.yml`, on
  main pushes, weekly, and pull requests that change image or dependency inputs
- **Supply-chain scoring:** `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` (OpenSSF Scorecard)
- **SBOM:** [`docs/SBOM.md`](./SBOM.md) — Syft-generated, attached to Docker releases
- **Disclosure process / access governance:** [`.github/SECURITY.md`](../.github/SECURITY.md),
  [`MAINTAINERS.md`](../.github/MAINTAINERS.md)
- **Test coverage:** `server/__tests__/ssrf.test.ts`, `ssrf_routes.test.ts`,
  `rss-ssrf.test.ts`, `downloaders_ssrf.test.ts`, `security.test.ts`,
  `security_error_handling.test.ts`, `auth-setup-ratelimit.test.ts`,
  `scan-ratelimit.test.ts`

## 7. Unauthenticated Surface

`server/routes.ts:845` registers `app.use("/api", authenticateToken)`, which gates every
route registered **after** that line. The routes below are registered **before** it and are
the actual unauthenticated surface:

| Route                                                | Rate-limited?                                   | Justification                                                                                         |

| `POST /api/auth/setup`                               | yes (`authRateLimiter`, added in this revision) | Creates the first admin account; short-circuits with 403 once a user exists.                          |
| `POST /api/auth/login`                               | yes (`authRateLimiter`)                         | Standard login brute-force protection.                                                                |

No route here exposes user data or performs a state-changing action without either explicit
authentication or a narrowly-scoped, low-sensitivity response.

## 8. Residual & Accepted Risks

QuestarrNG is not a multi-user application (see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §9) — the supported deployment has one trusted operator, so this is low severity by design, not a gap awaiting a fix. |
| Path-traversal checks in `sanitizeDownloaderData`/`sanitizeIndexerData` use a `!value.includes("..")` blocklist rather than the resolve-and-prefix-check pattern `server/routes.ts`'s file-browser endpoint uses | **Recommended follow-up**                 | Downstream consumers don't currently perform direct filesystem access with these values, so risk is low; migrating to the stronger pattern is still worthwhile for consistency.

## 9. Review Cadence

Re-review triggers, rather than a calendar chore that tends to get skipped:

- A new external integration is added.
- A new unauthenticated route is introduced (i.e., anything registered before the
  `routes.ts:845` gate).
- Authentication/session/authorization behavior changes.
- A major version bump.

Any maintainer or contributor should update this document as part of the PR that triggers
one of the above — see the testing policy in
[`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
