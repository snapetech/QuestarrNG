# Download processing, RomM, and security scans

QuestarrNG can process completed downloads automatically or present them for
review before they enter a library. Open **Settings → Import** to configure the
pipeline. Its tabs cover **General Config**, **RomM**, **Path Mappings**, and
**Security & Scanning**.

## Set up post-processing

1. In **General Config**, enable **Post-Processing** and choose the library
   root as QuestarrNG sees it (for example, `/data/games`).
2. Configure how files should be transferred and whether archives should be
   unpacked. You can also choose the rename pattern, platform eligibility,
   whether to sort detected DLC/updates/extras into subfolders, and whether to
   delete the source after a successful move or copy.
3. If a downloader uses a different host path from QuestarrNG, configure a
   **Path Mapping** so the server can resolve the completed download. The
   download and destination roots must be available to the QuestarrNG process.
4. Use the built-in hardlink check before selecting hardlinks. Hardlinks require
   compatible paths on the same filesystem; use copy or move when the source
   and library are on separate volumes.

For archive safety, QuestarrNG validates paths and links before extraction and
limits the default archive to 50,000 entries and 250 GiB of declared expanded
data. Set `ARCHIVE_MAX_ENTRIES` or `ARCHIVE_MAX_EXPANDED_BYTES` in the server
environment to change these limits. Each archive tool invocation has a
30-minute timeout. These checks do not replace filesystem quotas.

Downloads that need a destination choice, archive password, or other review
appear in the **Pending Imports** card on the Library page. Use **Review** to
inspect the proposed source and destination before confirming the import.

## Route ROM imports to RomM

QuestarrNG writes files into RomM's mounted library folders; it does not call
the RomM API. Mount the same storage into both services and make sure the
QuestarrNG process can read and write it.

1. Open **Settings → Import → RomM** and enable **Route ROM imports to RomM**.
2. Set **RomM ROM library root** to the path inside QuestarrNG's container or
   host process. The default shown by the app is `/data/romm/library/roms`.
3. Choose a folder layout:
   - **RomM platform slug** creates a platform folder from the configured
     RomM slug.
   - **Custom folder bindings** maps RomM slugs to relative folders under the
     library root using the JSON editor.
4. In **Platform slug mappings**, assign a RomM slug to each IGDB platform.
   Use **Load default platform mappings** when the list is empty. A blank slug
   leaves that platform's imports in the PC library.
5. Choose the transfer mode and how to handle an existing game. You can keep
   both files with a new name, skip, replace, or send the conflict for review.
   Single-file ROMs can go directly in the platform folder or in a game folder.
6. Save the settings. For a manual import, choose **RomM ROM library** in the
   review dialog when the option is available.

If a platform has no custom folder binding, select whether to fall back to its
RomM platform slug or require a binding. Folder bindings are relative to the
configured RomM library root, so they cannot select an arbitrary destination.

## Configure pre-import security scans

Both scanners are optional and disabled until configured. Open **Settings →
Import → Security & Scanning**. Save the settings before using **Test**; the
buttons test the saved configuration.

| Scanner        | What QuestarrNG sends                                                                                                                             | Configuration and behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VirusTotal** | A SHA-256 hash over HTTPS. The file itself is not uploaded. For a directory download, QuestarrNG checks the largest file as the primary artifact. | Enter an API key and set the detection threshold. An import is blocked when the number of malicious detections is greater than the threshold. Unknown hashes are allowed by default; enable **Block Unknown Hashes** to block them. |
| **ClamAV**     | File contents streamed to the configured ClamAV daemon over its INSTREAM TCP protocol.                                                            | Enter the daemon host and port (default `3310`). ClamAV examines up to 100 files in a directory download. A partial or incomplete directory scan blocks the import.                                                                 |

The VirusTotal API key is stored in QuestarrNG's database without encryption;
protect the database and its backups. ClamAV's INSTREAM connection is not
encrypted, so keep the daemon on a trusted network. See
[`SECRETS.md`](SECRETS.md) and [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) for the
security details.

Scanner network or timeout errors do not block an import. VirusTotal results
that are unknown or below the configured threshold also continue unless
**Block Unknown Hashes** applies. An incomplete ClamAV file listing is treated
as a block so QuestarrNG does not report a partial scan as clean. These checks
are optional defense in depth, not a guarantee that every file is safe.

## When a download is flagged

QuestarrNG moves a flagged download into a `.questarr-quarantine` directory
beside the selected library root, records its `quarantined` status, and creates
an in-app **Security Alert** when that notification is enabled. The item
appears in the Library page's **Pending Imports** card with the scanner reason.
A quarantined item has no **Review**
action, and the import endpoint rejects it even if a client tries to submit an
import plan directly.

The parent of the library root must be writable by QuestarrNG so it can create
the sibling quarantine directory. If `/data` is itself a read-only or
root-owned mount point, set the library root to a subdirectory such as
`/data/games` so quarantine can be created alongside it inside the writable
volume.

**Dismiss** clears the item from Pending Imports; it does not import, restore,
or delete the quarantined file, and it does not dismiss the separate
notification. Inspect or remove the file through the host filesystem according
to your own review process.
