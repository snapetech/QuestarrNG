# Migration Guide: PostgreSQL to SQLite

Questarr v1.1 moved from PostgreSQL to SQLite to simplify deployment and reduce
resource usage. This guide is for operators still running a **pre-v1.1
PostgreSQL** installation who need to bring that data across.

> **The migration tooling was removed in v1.5.0.** `scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts` and
> `docker-compose.migrate.yml` no longer ship with Questarr, because the schema
> has moved far enough since v1.1 that the tool only knew about 8 of the
> project's tables and would silently skip the rest. It is still available from
> the **v1.4.2** release, which is the supported way to run this migration —
> see below.
>
> **Not to be confused with the optional Postgres backend.** Questarr can now
> also be _run_ on PostgreSQL as an opt-in alternative to the SQLite default
> (from v1.5.0; see `docs/DATABASE.md`). That is a different thing entirely, and
> this guide does not apply to it. There is no automated path from that backend
> back to SQLite.

## Compatibility

The archived tool handles Questarr versions v1.0.0 through v1.1, including the
table renames, column renames and missing columns from that era. It does **not**
understand any table added since, so do not point it at a database from a later
version.

## Migration steps

Run this against the **v1.4.2** release. Pinning matters: the tool is not
present in `latest`, and `latest`'s schema is far ahead of what it understands.

1.  **Stop the current application:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -p <your-original-project-name> down app
    ```

    Pass `-p` here too, for the same reason it is needed in step 3 below: if
    your deployment used a custom project name, omitting it targets a
    different project and leaves your app running, writing to the database
    while the migration reads it. Step 2 explains how to find the name. If you
    never set one, drop the flag.

2.  **Save the compose file below** as `docker-compose.migrate.yml`.

    It is reproduced here in full, pinned to `v1.4.2`, because the file no
    longer exists on the default branch:

    ```yaml
    services:
      # Temporary Postgres service to access old data
      db:
        image: postgres:16-alpine
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
          - POSTGRES_DB=questarr
        volumes:
          - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
          interval: 10s
          timeout: 5s
          retries: 5

      # The migrator service (your app)
      migrator:
        image: ghcr.io/doezer/questarr:v1.4.2
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=production
          - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/questarr
          # Path where the SQLite DB will be created inside the container
          - SQLITE_DB_PATH=/app/data/sqlite.db
        volumes:
          # Map a local 'data' folder to receive the migrated database
          - ./data:/app/data
        depends_on:
          db:
            condition: service_healthy
        # Chain: 1. Push schema to SQLite, 2. Run the PG->SQLite migration script
        command: sh -c "node dist/server/run-migrations.js && node dist/scripts/pg-to-sqlite.js"

    volumes:
      postgres_data:
    ```

    This is the archived file verbatim, with only the image tag changed from
    `latest` to `v1.4.2`.

    **Run it under your original Compose project name**, or it will create a
    brand-new empty `postgres_data` volume instead of reusing yours. Compose
    namespaces volumes as `<project>_<volume>`, and the project name comes from
    the first of these that is set: `-p` on the command line,
    `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, a top-level `name:` in the compose file, and only
    then the directory name. Running from the same directory reproduces just
    that last, default case. If your original deployment set any of the others,
    pass it explicitly:

    ```bash
    docker compose -p <your-original-project-name> -f docker-compose.migrate.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
    ```

    `docker volume ls | grep postgres_data` shows the existing volume's full
    name; the part before `_postgres_data` is the project name to use.

    **Set `DATABASE_URL` to your original credentials and database name.**
    This is the line that matters, and it is easy to get wrong: the
    `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` variables on the `db`
    service only take effect when Postgres initializes an _empty_ data
    directory. Against your existing volume they do nothing — the role,
    password and database name already stored there win. Editing them while
    leaving `DATABASE_URL` at the sample
    `postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/questarr` is precisely the
    mistake that produces an empty result, because the migrator only reads
    `DATABASE_URL`.

3.  **Run the migration**, with the same project name as step 1:

    ```bash
    docker compose -p <your-original-project-name> -f docker-compose.migrate.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
    ```

4.  **Verify before starting Questarr.** Do not trust the exit status: the
    archived script catches failures per table, logs them, and still prints
    `Migration completed.` at the end. A wrong `DATABASE_URL` therefore looks
    like a clean run while producing an empty or partial database.

    Read the `--- Migration Summary ---` table it prints and confirm the row
    counts match your expectations, and that no line reads
    `❌ Failed to migrate table` or `⚠️ Integrity Check Failed`. Then spot-check
    the result directly:

    ```bash
    sqlite3 ./data/sqlite.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
    ```

    Only once that looks right, start Questarr normally on the current release.
    Your data now lives in `./data/sqlite.db`.

## Source

The tool as it last shipped, for inspection or manual use:

- [`scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts` at v1.4.2](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr/blob/v1.4.2/scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts)
- [`docker-compose.migrate.yml` at v1.4.2](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr/blob/v1.4.2/docker-compose.migrate.yml)

These are tag permalinks and will keep resolving after the files leave the
default branch.
