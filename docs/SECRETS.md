# Secrets & Credentials Management

This document describes every place QuestarrNG stores or handles sensitive
values — environment configuration, third-party API credentials, and the
indexer/downloader/user credentials that users enter through the app — how
access to them is controlled, and how they get rotated. It reflects the
current state of the code; gaps are called out explicitly rather than
glossed over.

## 1. Environment variables

All configuration is optional; sensible defaults are used when a variable
is unset. See [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr/blob/main/.env.example) for the canonical template.
`.env` is loaded once via `dotenv/config` at `server/index.ts:2` and parsed
against a Zod schema in `server/config.ts:10-59`. If any variable fails
validation, the server logs the error and exits (`server/config.ts:64-80`)
rather than starting with an invalid configuration.

| Variable                                | Purpose                                                       | Required?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `ARCHIVE_MAX_ENTRIES`                   | Max entries an archive may list before import extraction      | No (default `50000`). Archives listing more entries are refused before extraction. See [Archive extraction limits](#archive-extraction-limits) |
| `ARCHIVE_MAX_EXPANDED_BYTES`            | Max total declared uncompressed size of an archive, in bytes  | No (default `268435456000`, 250 GiB). Archives declaring more are refused before extraction. See [Archive extraction limits](#archive-extraction-limits) |

For the optional PostgreSQL backend, set `DB_DIALECT=postgres` and supply
`DATABASE_URL`. That connection string contains the database username and
password; keep it out of source control and protect the environment file or
secret store that supplies it. See [`docs/DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md).

A legacy hardcoded default, `"questarr-default-secret-change-me"`, is
explicitly rejected by a Zod `.refine()` (`server/config.ts:18-24`) so the
app can never silently run with that well-known value.

The `.env` file itself is git-ignored (see `.gitignore`) and must never be
committed. `docker-compose*.local.yml` and `gha-creds-*.json` are ignored
for the same reason.

### Archive extraction limits

When an import finds an archive (`.rar`, `.zip`, `.7z`, and so on), Questarr
lists its contents and checks every entry before extracting anything. RAR
archives are listed with `unrar lt -v`; other formats use 7-Zip. Questarr
refuses the archive, and the import fails with an error, if any of these is
true:

| Check                                                                                         | Error message                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| More entries than `ARCHIVE_MAX_ENTRIES`                                                       | `Archive contains too many entries (limit: N).`                       |
| Total declared uncompressed size above `ARCHIVE_MAX_EXPANDED_BYTES`                           | `Archive expands beyond the configured size limit (N bytes).`         |
| An entry with an absolute path, a drive letter (`C:`), a `..` segment, or more than 64 levels | `Archive contains an unsafe file path.`                               |
| An entry that would resolve outside the extraction directory                                  | `Archive contains a file path outside the extraction directory.`      |
| A symbolic link or hard link                                                                  | `Archive contains a symbolic or hard link, which is not extracted.`   |
| An entry with a missing or invalid uncompressed size                                          | `Archive contains an entry with an invalid uncompressed size.`        |

The path and link checks always apply. If a legitimate release is refused
for size or entry count, raise the matching limit and restart the server:

```bash
# .env
ARCHIVE_MAX_ENTRIES=200000
ARCHIVE_MAX_EXPANDED_BYTES=536870912000 # 500 GiB
```

Both values must be positive whole numbers. Questarr reads them at startup,
outside the Zod schema above, so an empty, zero, negative, or non-numeric
value is ignored and the default applies instead of stopping the server.
See [`docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`](SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md) for why these
checks exist.

## 2. Authentication secret (`JWT_SECRET`)

Session tokens are signed HS256 JWTs (`jsonwebtoken`), 7-day expiry
(`server/auth.ts:77-82`), verified on every authenticated request by
`authenticateToken` / `optionalAuthenticateToken` (`server/auth.ts:88-126`).

Resolution order for the signing secret, `getJwtSecret()`
(`server/auth.ts:13-67`):

1. In-memory cache for the life of the process.
2. `JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
3. Value stored in the `system_config` table under key `jwt_secret`.
4. If none of the above exist, generate 64 random bytes
   (`crypto.randomBytes(64).toString("hex")`) and persist them to
   `system_config` for future restarts.

If DB persistence fails (e.g. read-only filesystem), the generated secret
is still used in memory for that process, but a warning is logged since it
won't survive a restart and will invalidate all sessions when it does.

**Rotation:** there is no dedicated "rotate JWT secret" endpoint. To force
all users to re-authenticate, either set/change the `JWT_SECRET` env var,
or delete the `jwt_secret` row from `system_config` — a new one will be
generated automatically on next use. Either action invalidates every
existing session.

## 3. Third-party API credentials

For credential-editing settings, `GET` never returns the actual secret. When
updating other fields, send the sentinel string `"********"` to keep an
unchanged secret. `GET /api/settings/igdb` returns
the `clientId` but never the `clientSecret` (`server/routes.ts:2709-2768`
sends/accepts the sentinel). `GET /api/settings/nexusmods` returns only
`{ configured, source }` booleans (`server/routes.ts:3311-3342`).
`GET /api/settings/discord` returns `{ configured, webhookUrl: "********" }`
when set, and `POST` treats the sentinel as "no change"
(`server/routes.ts:2769-2801`). The VirusTotal key is likewise masked by
`GET /api/settings/security-scan` and its sentinel means "keep the current
key" on `POST` (`server/routes.ts:4823-4873`). These handlers sit behind
`sensitiveEndpointLimiter`. The VirusTotal key is stored unencrypted in the
database, so protect the QuestarrNG database and its backups accordingly.

When PostgreSQL is enabled with `DB_DIALECT=postgres`, `DATABASE_URL` contains
the database username and password. Keep it out of source control and protect
the environment file or secret store that supplies it. See
[`docs/DATABASE.md`](DATABASE.md) for backend configuration.

## 4. User-entered indexer & downloader credentials

This is the largest surface of stored secrets: Torznab/Newznab indexer API
keys, and usernames/passwords for download clients (qBittorrent,
Transmission, rTorrent, sabnzbd, nzbget).

- **Storage:** encrypted at rest. `indexers.apiKey` and
  `downloaders.username` / `downloaders.password` are AES-256-GCM encrypted
  before being written to SQLite and decrypted on read
  (`server/credential-crypto.ts`, wired into `server/storage.ts`'s
  `addIndexer`/`updateIndexer`/`getIndexer`/`getAllIndexers`/`getEnabledIndexers`/
  `syncIndexers` and the equivalent downloader methods). Each encrypted value
  is prefixed `enc:v1:` and stores a random 12-byte IV + auth tag + ciphertext,
  base64-encoded — so two encryptions of the same plaintext never look alike
  at rest. Rows written before this feature existed are legacy plaintext;
  `decryptCredential()` detects the missing prefix and returns them unchanged
  (no migration required), and they get encrypted the next time they're
  saved.
  - **Encryption key:** resolved the same way as `JWT_SECRET` (§2) —
    `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var, then the DB `system_config` key
    `credentials_encryption_key`, then auto-generated (32 random bytes) and
    persisted (`server/credential-crypto.ts:getCredentialsEncryptionKey`).
    Losing this key (e.g. wiping `system_config` without also setting the
    env var) makes previously encrypted rows undecryptable.
- **In transit to the indexer/download client:** the storage layer decrypts
  transparently, so `server/downloaders/*.ts` and `server/search.ts` receive
  plaintext exactly as before — HTTP Basic Auth (base64, not encryption) for
  qBittorrent/Transmission-style clients, and RFC 2617 Digest Auth
  challenge-response for rTorrent (`server/downloaders/rtorrent.ts:596-621`).
  - **MD5 fallback (accepted risk):** RFC 2617's classic Digest Auth only
    defines MD5; `rtorrent.ts:596,599` uses SHA-256 whenever the rTorrent/
    ruTorrent server's challenge advertises `algorithm=SHA-256`, and falls
    back to MD5 only for servers that don't (the common case, since most
    rTorrent/ruTorrent builds still only implement the original RFC 2617
    MD5 scheme). This is an interoperability requirement, not a choice —
    there is no more-secure alternative that the target servers accept.
    Risk is limited: the digest response is an HMAC-style construction
    keyed by server-issued `nonce`/client `cnonce` per request
    (`rtorrent.ts:608-621`), not a bare hash of the credential, so MD5's
    known collision weakness doesn't directly expose the password —
    the exposure is the same one every RFC 2617 MD5 deployment has always
    carried. Mitigation: always prefer a downloader/network path that
    terminates in TLS between QuestarrNG and the rTorrent host where
    possible, since Digest Auth (either hash) still doesn't encrypt the
    request/response bodies themselves. No other code path in QuestarrNG
    depends on MD5.
- **Access control / API exposure:** every indexer/downloader route sits
  behind the global `authenticateToken` middleware (`server/routes.ts:821-829`).
  `GET /api/indexers`, `GET /api/indexers/:id`, `GET /api/downloaders`, and
  `GET /api/downloaders/:id` mask the secret field before responding —
  `apiKey` / `password` come back as `"********"` whenever a real value is
  set (`maskIndexer`/`maskDownloader` helpers, `server/routes.ts`). The same
  masking applies to the `POST`/`PATCH` responses. `username` is not treated
  as a secret and is still returned in full, matching how it's used (a login
  name, not a token).
- **Rotation:** `PATCH /api/indexers/:id` / `PATCH /api/downloaders/:id`
  follow the IGDB masked-sentinel convention — sending `"********"` for
  `apiKey`/`password` leaves the stored value unchanged (the sentinel is
  stripped from the update before it reaches storage); sending any other
  value overwrites and re-encrypts it. This is what lets the edit dialogs
  prefill the field with the mask without silently clobbering the real
  secret on save.

## 5. User account passwords

`users.passwordHash` (`shared/schema.ts:6-11`) never stores plaintext.
Hashing uses `bcryptjs` with `SALT_ROUNDS = 10` (`server/auth.ts:1,10,69-75`).
Passwords are hashed on signup (`server/routes.ts:309`), verified on login
(`server/routes.ts:369-371`), and the password-change endpoint requires the
current password before accepting a new one
(`server/routes.ts:392-419`).

## 6. Rate limiting around credentials (`server/middleware.ts`)

| Limiter                    | Limit                     | Applied to                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authRateLimiter`          | 20 requests / 15 min / IP | `POST /api/auth/login`                                                                                   |
| `sensitiveEndpointLimiter` | 30 requests / min / IP    | Indexer/downloader writes, password change, IGDB/NexusMods/Discord settings, SSL settings, Prowlarr sync |
| `generalApiLimiter`        | 600 requests / min / IP   | General fallback                                                                                         |
| `scanRateLimiter`          | 10 requests / min / user  | `GET /api/games/:gameId/files` (on-disk file scan for a game)                                            |

`scanRateLimiter` keys on the authenticated user ID. For unauthenticated
requests it falls back to the client IP, grouping IPv6 addresses by subnet
so a single client can't bypass the limit by rotating addresses within its
prefix.

There is no account lockout beyond the IP-based `authRateLimiter` window
for repeated failed logins.

## 7. Version control hygiene

Secret-bearing files are excluded via `.gitignore`: `.env`, `sqlite.db*`,
`data/*`, `data_test/`, `.sofa/` (SOFA agent credentials —
see `.claude/sofa-skill.md`), and `gha-creds-*.json`. No `.env` or database
file is currently tracked in git. Never commit real credentials in
`docker-compose*.yml` — use `.env` or a local override file
(`docker-compose.*local.yml`, also git-ignored) instead.

## 8. Credential exposure in operational scripts

**Real in v1.1.0–v1.3.1. Fixed in v1.4.0. Rotate if you kept the logs.**

`scripts/pg-to-sqlite.ts` logged the full `DATABASE_URL` connection string
before connecting:

```ts
console.log(`Connecting to Postgres: ${pgUrl}`); // v1.1.0 – v1.3.1
```

Per standard `postgresql://` URL convention that string embeds
`user:password@host`, so the credential was printed in plaintext, where it
could land in CI logs, container logs or shell history.

Commit `99984867` ("Fix visible postgreSQL URL in migration log") removed the
interpolation. From **v1.4.0** onward the line is a constant
``console.log(`Connecting to Postgres`)`` and the script logs nothing derived
from `DATABASE_URL` — the only connection detail it prints is the SQLite path,
which is not a credential.

| Tags                                                       | Behavior          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, `v1.2.2`, `v1.3.0`, `v1.3.1` | logs the full URL |
| `v1.4.0`, `v1.4.1`, `v1.4.2`                               | constant, no URL  |

**If you ran the migration on any of the six affected tags and still hold those
logs, treat that Postgres password as exposed and rotate it.** Purging the logs
is not sufficient on its own if they were ever shipped to a log aggregator or a
CI provider.

This section previously read as an open, unfixed finding, because it was never
updated when `99984867` landed. It also carried a line reference that by then
pointed at the fixed line. The script has since been removed entirely, for
unrelated reasons — it understood only 8 of the project's 19 tables — see
[MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md). The archived **v1.4.2** tool that migration now
points operators at is on the safe side of the fix.

## 9. Summary checklist for operators

- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` explicitly in production so sessions survive
      restarts and DB resets.
- [ ] Set `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` explicitly in production so stored
      indexer/downloader credentials stay decryptable across DB resets
      (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
- [ ] Set IGDB and (optionally) NexusMods credentials via `.env` or
      Settings → Services.
- [ ] If using PostgreSQL, protect `DATABASE_URL` and its password-bearing
      environment file or secret store.
- [ ] Restrict who has login access to the app — QuestarrNG has no per-user
      role scoping, so any account holder can use every configured
      indexer/downloader (though the API keys/passwords themselves are
      masked in responses and encrypted at rest, per §4).
- [ ] Run behind HTTPS/a reverse proxy per `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] Never commit `.env`, `sqlite.db`, or `docker-compose.local.yml`.
- [ ] If you ran `pg-to-sqlite` on v1.1.0–v1.3.1 and kept the logs, rotate that
      Postgres password — those versions printed the full `DATABASE_URL` (§8).
- [ ] If running the archived v1.4.2 `pg-to-sqlite` migration tool, set
      `DATABASE_URL` to your real source credentials and verify the row counts
      it reports — it continues past per-table failures and still reports
      success (see [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md)).
