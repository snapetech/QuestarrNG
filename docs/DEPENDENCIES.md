# Dependency Management

This document describes how Questarr selects, obtains, and tracks its dependencies.

## Selection

Dependencies are added deliberately as part of normal development, via `npm install`, and land in `package.json` alongside the feature or fix that needs them. Preference is given to actively maintained, widely used packages already common in the Node/React ecosystem. New dependencies go through the same pull request review process as any other code change (see [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)) before merging to `main`.

## Obtaining dependencies

- Packages are installed from the public [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- `package-lock.json` is committed to the repository and used for reproducible installs — the exact resolved version of every direct and transitive dependency is pinned.
- The `packageManager` field in `package.json` pins the npm version used to install and build the project.
- `global.json` pins the .NET SDK used to build the Windows service; Dependabot tracks SDK servicing releases with the `dotnet-sdk` ecosystem.
- The `allowScripts` field in `package.json` explicitly allowlists which packages are permitted to run install-time (postinstall) scripts. It's npm's own native field (npm ≥ 11.16.0), managed via `npm approve-scripts` / `npm deny-scripts`, not a third-party tool — today it's advisory (npm flags unreviewed scripts but still runs them), with a future npm release expected to block unapproved scripts by default. Any package added here should have a concrete reason (e.g. a native module that needs to compile a binary during install).
- The `overrides` field forces a specific version of a transitive dependency when a direct dependency's own declared range still permits a vulnerable release:
  - `socket.io-parser: 4.2.6` patches [CVE-2026-33151](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/security/advisories/GHSA-677m-j7p3-52f9) (resource exhaustion via unbounded binary attachments). Needed because `socket.io`/`socket.io-client` declare `socket.io-parser: ~4.2.4`, a range that still allows the unpatched 4.2.4/4.2.5.
  - `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`'s `esbuild` dependency is bumped to `^0.25.0` to patch the esbuild dev-server request-forwarding issue ([GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)). Needed because `drizzle-kit` pulls in `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader` → `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`, which pins `esbuild: ~0.18.20`.
  - `body-parser: 1.20.6` patches [CVE-2026-12590](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6) (invalid `limit` values silently disabling size enforcement). Needed because `express` bundles `body-parser: ~1.20.5`.
  - `qs: ^6.16.0` patches [GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g) (DoS via attacker-controlled `isBuffer`, affecting `>=2.2.5 <6.16.0`) and [GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx) (array-limit bypass via bracket-key comma parsing, affecting `>=6.14.2 <=6.15.3`). Needed because `express` and `body-parser` both pin `qs: ~6.15.1`, which excludes the patched `6.16.0` — npm's only other remedy was a semver-major bump to `express@5`. The override also covers `openid`, `steam-web` and `superagent`, whose own ranges likewise still permit a vulnerable release.
  - `brace-expansion: ^5.0.12` patches [GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895) (DoS via unbounded intermediate arrays), the [CVE-2026-14257](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg) mitigation, and the newer recursion and quadratic-time DoS advisories [GHSA-q2hr-2g5m-vwhr](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2hr-2g5m-vwhr), [GHSA-qhr7-859c-m2p7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qhr7-859c-m2p7), and [GHSA-6j4f-fj2g-mc7p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6j4f-fj2g-mc7p). The override keeps `archiver`'s `readdir-glob`/`minimatch` dependency chain on a patched release.
  - `fast-uri: ^3.1.8` patches [CVE-2026-16221](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx), four HIGH advisories fixed in 3.1.6, and the host-normalization issue [GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj). Needed because `ajv@8.20.0`'s own declared range (`^3.0.1`, then `^3.1.5`) kept allowing an unpatched release. `ajv` is a shared transitive dependency of both `secretlint` (dev-only) and the production `@hookform/resolvers` (as a `peerOptional` dependency), so `fast-uri` is reachable in production — confirmed by `npm audit --omit=dev`.
  - `proxy-addr: ^2.0.8` patches [CVE-2026-90711](https://vuldb.com/cve/CVE-2026-90711) ([AIKIDO-2026-101201](https://security.aikido.dev/cve/AIKIDO-2026-101201), critical: accepts undersized IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust subnets, letting unauthenticated clients spoof `X-Forwarded-For` and bypass IP-based access controls, rate limiting, and audit logging), affecting `>=1.1.0 <=2.0.7`. Needed because `express` pins `proxy-addr: ~2.0.7`, which had not yet bumped its declared range to include the patched `2.0.8`.
  - `eslint-plugin-react`'s `eslint` dependency is bumped to `^10.9.1` to allow ESLint v10 support. Needed because `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.2` officially supports only up to `eslint@^9.7`, but the linting rules in ESLint v10 are stricter and require updating the codebase to comply. This override is temporary — once `eslint-plugin-react` releases a new major version with official ESLint v10 support, it can be removed.
  - All of the above should be revisited (and likely removed) once the upstream packages bump their own internal dependency ranges past the vulnerable versions.
  - The `check-overrides` CI job (`npm run check:overrides`, see [`scripts/check-overrides.mjs`](../scripts/check-overrides.mjs)) checks this automatically on every PR and fails once an override is no longer needed, so there's no need to track removal manually.

## Tracking and updates

[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) is configured in [`.github/dependabot.yml`](../.github/dependabot.yml) for npm, NuGet, the .NET SDK, Docker images, and GitHub Actions. npm, NuGet, .NET SDK, and Actions updates run weekly; Docker image updates run daily:

- Version updates are opened as grouped pull requests (e.g. React-related packages, Radix UI components, dev vs. production dependencies, and all GitHub Actions bumps). Security updates are grouped by ecosystem as well.
- Semver-major bumps are proposed automatically like any other update rather than excluded, since silently skipping them meant a major-version-only security fix could go unnoticed; they aren't folded into the minor/patch groups, so they still land as their own PR and get individual review.
- Every dependency-update PR runs through the same CI gate as any other change — lint, type check, the full test suite, and a Docker build (see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) — before it can be merged.

## Release-time visibility

Every published Docker image ships with a generated Software Bill of Materials listing the exact versions of every dependency included in that release. See [docs/SBOM.md](SBOM.md) for how to inspect it.

## Currently blocked updates

Tracked here so a blocked Dependabot PR doesn't get silently re-proposed and re-investigated from scratch. Remove an entry once its update is unblocked and merged.

_As of 2026-07-04, `release/1.4.0`:_

- **`@hookform/resolvers`** `3.10.0` → `5.4.0` (PR #756) — blocked. Installs, but the TypeScript check fails in form resolver usage (`client/src/pages/downloaders.tsx`, `client/src/pages/indexers.tsx`). The project is on Zod 3 (`zod: ^3.25.0`); this upgrade likely needs resolver/schema compatibility adjustments first.
- **React 19** `react 18.3.1` → `19.2.7`, `@types/react 18.3.11` → `19.2.17` (PR #761) — blocked. Install fails on peer dependency resolution across UI dependencies; needs a broader compatibility pass across the React ecosystem packages first.
