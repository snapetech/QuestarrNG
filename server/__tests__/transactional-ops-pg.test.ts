/**
 * Postgres-only regressions for server/db/transactional-ops.pg.ts.
 *
 * These don't belong in dialect-parity.test.ts: that suite asserts identical
 * behaviour across backends, but the bugs here are specific to how Postgres
 * transactions work. Unlike better-sqlite3's synchronous transactions, a
 * failed statement puts the whole Postgres transaction into an aborted state
 * until rollback -- every later statement in it fails too, "current
 * transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block".
 * SQLite has no equivalent failure mode, so there is nothing to compare against.
