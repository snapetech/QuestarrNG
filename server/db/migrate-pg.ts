 * Postgres migration runner.
 *
 * Drizzle's migrator reads migration state and applies pending files
 * transactionally, tracking them by hash -- but it takes no lock of its own.
 * Two Questarr instances starting at once could both see the same pending
 * migration and double-apply it. A database-wide advisory lock, held on one
 * dedicated connection for the whole run, serializes concurrent starts: the
 * second instance blocks here until the first finishes and commits its
 * migration records.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: the schema-drift repair in
 * server/db/migrate-sqlite.ts is not ported here, and should not be. That code
 * exists to patch installs that ran an intermediate build before a migration
 * file existed -- a situation with no Postgres equivalent, because Postgres
 * support shipped with a single baseline migration and every Postgres install
 * is therefore greenfield.
 *
 * Also runs under QUESTARR_DB_DRIVER=pglite (tests): PGlite has no connection
 * pool to check out from, it IS the one connection, so the lock and unlock
 * below simply run on it directly -- pg_advisory_unlock must run on the exact
 * session that took the lock, which a pool's own .query() does not guarantee.
