/**
 * In-process Postgres, for tests only.
 *
 * PGlite is a real Postgres compiled to WebAssembly, so it exercises the actual
 * Postgres parser and planner -- jsonb casts, string_agg, ILIKE, bigint-as-string,
 * boolean vs 0, async transactions -- without requiring a server. That keeps the
 * default test loop as fast and infra-free as it was when SQLite was the only
 * backend.
 *
 * It is NOT a substitute for a real server: PGlite is single-connection, so it
 * cannot surface pool exhaustion, lock contention or deadlock ordering. There is
 * currently no CI job that runs these suites against a real Postgres server --
 * see "Known gaps" in this PR's description.
 *
 * Selected with QUESTARR_DB_DRIVER=pglite. @electric-sql/pglite is a
 * devDependency and is imported dynamically so that production installs, where
 * devDependencies are pruned, never try to resolve it.
