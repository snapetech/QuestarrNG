## 2024-05-23 - N+1 Query Optimization

**Learning:** Sequential API calls in a loop (N+1 pattern) significantly degrade performance.
**Action:** Always prefer batched API methods (like `getGamesByIds`) and process updates in concurrency-limited chunks (e.g., using `Promise.all` with a chunking loop).

## 2025-02-18 - SQLite Batch Updates

**Learning:** SQLite performance for bulk updates is heavily dependent on transaction overhead. Updating items one-by-one in a loop creates implicit transactions for each update, which is slow.
**Action:** Wrap multiple update statements in a single `db.transaction` (batching) to significantly reduce I/O overhead and increase throughput.

## 2025-05-23 - Batch Transaction Optimization

**Learning:** Performing multiple inserts/updates in a loop without a transaction causes significant I/O overhead due to repeated fsyncs.
**Action:** Encapsulate bulk synchronization logic (like syncing indexers) within a single `db.transaction` in the storage layer, and pre-fetch existing records to avoid N+1 read queries.

## 2024-03-18 - Missing memoization in frequently rendered components

**Learning:** Found that multiple components like `AppSidebar`, `library.tsx`, and `wishlist.tsx` were performing O(n) array filtering (`games.filter(...)`) on every render. Because `AppSidebar` renders on every page and updates frequently (e.g. from active downloads polling), these unmemoized calculations could cause noticeable jank as the library grows.
**Action:** Always check if derived array data (like filtering or sorting) in top-level or frequently updated components is properly wrapped in `useMemo`, especially when the source array comes from a global query cache like React Query.

## 2025-05-23 - Unmemoized React Query array data transformations

**Learning:** React Query frequently triggers re-renders on components. Any heavy transformation derived from query results (e.g. filtering, O(N log N) sorting, date parsing) directly inside the component body will fire on every re-render and degrade performance.
**Action:** Extract list transformations or sorting using results from React Query into `useMemo`, ensuring `searchResults?.items` or equivalent array paths are added to the dependency array.

## 2025-05-23 - Expensive String-to-Date Conversions in Render Loops

**Learning:** Parsing `YYYY-MM-DD` strings back to `Date` objects inside a component's `.filter()` or `.map()` loop during render is extremely slow and can lead to bugs with timezone offsets. In `YearView`, re-evaluating date objects caused unnecessary memory allocations and degraded calendar rendering performance.
**Action:** When comparing date strings (e.g. bucketizing games by month), prefer O(1) string prefix matching (like `date.startsWith('2024-05-')`) over parsing the string into a new `Date` object to check its bounds.

## 2024-04-22 - Dashboard Stats Computation Optimization

**Learning:** Found multiple O(n) array traversals (filter, map, reduce, flatMap) within a React useMemo hook processing game statistics. Replacing these multiple array methods with a single manual loop significantly improves performance on the hot path (re-evaluating stats) by reducing redundant iterations and object allocations.
**Action:** Always scrutinize React useMemo hooks operating on collections for unnecessary or repeated iterations, and consider combining loops.

## 2025-05-23 - Consolidating Multiple Array Traversals in Render Cycles

**Learning:** Extracting multiple derived states (e.g., separating games into `wanted`, `undated`, and grouping by date) using separate `useMemo` hooks with multiple array methods (`filter`, `filter`, `forEach`) iterates over the same list multiple times (O(3N)). When the source array changes (like `searchQuery` updates), it causes redundant iteration and object allocation, which can cause frame drops on large collections.
**Action:** When computing multiple derived states from the same dependency array, consolidate the logic into a single manual `for` loop inside a single `useMemo` block to achieve a single pass (O(N)). Also, always ensure invariant derivations (like `.toLowerCase()`) are evaluated outside the loop.

## 2025-05-23 - Stats Computation Optimization

**Learning:** Found multiple O(N) array traversals (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `flatMap`) within `calculateLibraryStats` processing game statistics. Replacing these with a single manual loop significantly improves performance on the hot path (re-evaluating stats) by reducing redundant iterations and object allocations.
**Action:** Always scrutinize React useMemo hooks operating on collections for unnecessary or repeated iterations, and consider combining loops.

## 2026-07-29 - Expensive Date Parsing in Array Sorting

**Learning:** Instantiating `Date` objects (e.g., `new Date(a.date).getTime()`) or using `localeCompare` inside array sorting loops (like in `sortGames`) causes significant performance degradation due to millions of allocations and complex collation rules during O(N log N) operations.
**Action:** When sorting arrays by ISO date strings, always use primitive string comparison operators (`<`, `>`) to ensure O(1) comparison overhead. This is only safe when every value shares the same normalized timezone, layout, and precision (e.g. all `YYYY-MM-DD` or all UTC `Z`-suffixed timestamps); dates that mix offsets or formats must be normalized to one canonical representation before comparing them lexically.

## 2026-07-29 - SonarCloud Duplication & Types

**Learning:** When extracting code logic to satisfy SonarCloud Maintainability and Duplication gates (such as creating helper functions to eliminate nested ternaries), ensure that the TypeScript method signature explicitly allows the types of the underlying variables (e.g., `Date | number | string | null | undefined`) instead of using `as unknown as string` casts, which bypasses the type-checker and reduces code safety.
**Action:** Define broad, accurate union types for helper functions rather than aggressively casting parameters to fit narrow function signatures.

## 2026-07-30 - O(N) Array Filter Optimization

**Learning:** Using chained `.filter(...).length` calls for counting evaluates the entire array on each pass and creates unnecessary array allocations for items that are immediately discarded. In heavily re-rendered components like `AppSidebar`, this degrades performance. SonarCloud also flags manual index-based `for` loops over arrays when the index itself is unused — a `for...of` loop is the preferred single-pass form.
**Action:** When counting items based on a condition, use a memoized `for...of` loop to increment a counter instead of `.filter(...).length`. Also hoist any `useQuery` no-data fallback (e.g. `data: x = []`) to a stable module-level constant — an inline `[]` default creates a new array reference on every render with no data, which defeats a `useMemo` keyed on that value.

## 2024-05-23 - Expensive Date Instantiation in Render Loops

**Learning:** Extracting `new Date()` out of `filter()` loops in frequently rendered components, such as `CalendarPage`'s year view, is critical. Using string comparison (`startsWith`) over allocating a Date object per iteration prevents severe O(N) allocation and performance degredation on keystrokes.
**Action:** When filtering dates by year or month inside array operations like `.map` or `.filter`, cache string representations outside the loop or utilize O(1) string matching (`startsWith`) instead of runtime Date allocations, provided the timezone bounds allow for it.
