# QuestarrNG

## Snapetech QuestarrNG fork

This fork adds the SeerrNG catalog and acquisition contract. Use
`ghcr.io/snapetech/questarrng:latest` or the Compose file in this repository;
the upstream Questarr image does not contain the SeerrNG integration routes.
The fork image is published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` from `main`.

Support QuestarrNG on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/snapetech).

### SeerrNG integration

QuestarrNG provides SeerrNG with an IGDB catalog and request-scoped PC-game
acquisition through a versioned, authenticated integration API. The contract
keeps SeerrNG's request ID and selected OS/architecture attached to Questarr's
tracked game and download records. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for the
catalog, status, retry, cancellation, and imported-file streaming routes.
Cancellation stops only downloads safely correlated to the SeerrNG request;
completed files remain on disk, and ambiguous active downloads are refused. If
Questarr restarts during a handoff before recording its download, it pauses the
request for a duplicate-download check before retrying or cancelling. The retry
or cancel endpoint returns `409` with `confirmationRequired` until the caller
checks the download queue/history and sends `confirmNoExistingDownload: true`.

## Installation

Docker is the easiest way to deploy Questarr with all dependencies included. Questarr uses a SQLite database which is self-contained in the application container.

The optional Windows installer runs Questarr as a Windows service and bundles
its service host as a self-contained .NET 10 LTS executable. Questarr itself is
a Node.js application; the installer does not require a separate .NET runtime.

**Supported architectures:** released Docker images are published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so Questarr runs on a Raspberry Pi 4/5 with a 64-bit OS, other 64-bit ARM SBCs, and ARM-based NAS boxes as well as on x86 hardware. Docker selects the right architecture automatically — the commands below are identical on every platform. (32-bit ARM, e.g. `armv7`/a 32-bit OS on Raspberry Pi 3 and earlier, is not supported. The [Home Assistant add-on](#home-assistant-add-on) is `amd64`-only.)

### Option 1: One-liner (Simplest but minimal)

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v ./data:/app/data --name questarrng ghcr.io/snapetech/questarrng:latest
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (more detailed)

1. **Use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file from the repo or create a minimal one:**

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: ghcr.io/snapetech/questarrng:latest
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
         - ./data:/app/data
       environment:
         - SQLITE_DB_PATH=/app/data/sqlite.db
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

2. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

For a non-root runtime with a read-only container filesystem, drop all Linux
capabilities, and block privilege escalation, use the
[`docker-compose.hardened.yml`](docker-compose.hardened.yml) overlay. It runs
the app as the configured `PUID:PGID` directly, so prepare the bind-mounted
`./data` directory with that ownership before starting it.

4. **Optional — use Postgres instead of SQLite:**

   Questarr uses SQLite by default and needs no database configuration. If you
   would rather run it against Postgres, use the bundled compose file:

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 32) docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
   ```

   Keep whatever password you pick — the same value must be supplied on every
   restart, and it must be safe to embed in a connection URL (a hex string
   from `openssl rand -hex 32` always is).

   Switching an existing SQLite install to Postgres does not move your data —
   run `scripts/sqlite-to-pg.ts` to bring your library across. See
   [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md).

### Proxmox VE (LXC)

<details>
<summary><b>Deploy as a Proxmox LXC container — no Docker</b></summary>

Run this **on your Proxmox VE host**, as `root`, to create an LXC container with Questarr installed
and running as a `systemd` service:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl --fail --silent --show-error --location --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG/main/scripts/proxmox/questarr-lxc.sh)"
```

The script picks the next free container ID, downloads a Debian template if needed, creates an
unprivileged container, builds Questarr from source, and prints the URL to open. Every prompt has a
default, so you can accept them all and be done in a few minutes.

Update later with `pct exec <ctid> -- update`.

See [docs/PROXMOX.md](docs/PROXMOX.md) for non-interactive installs, sizing guidance, configuration,
and troubleshooting.

</details>

### UNRAID

<details>
<summary><b>Install via Community Applications</b></summary>

The upstream **Questarr** Community Apps entry uses the upstream image and
does not include this fork's SeerrNG integration routes. Use the
[QuestarrNG fork template](unraid/questarr.xml)
for `ghcr.io/snapetech/questarrng:latest`. QuestarrNG works as a standalone
game manager; SeerrNG integration is optional. For package or integration
support, use the [SeerrNG issue tracker](https://github.com/snapetech/seerrng/issues).

1. Install the **QuestarrNG** template rather than the upstream **Questarr** template.
2. Set your **Data Path** (default `/mnt/user/appdata/questarrng`), **PUID**/**PGID**, and HTTP port (default `5000`).
3. Set the **Game Library** and **Downloads** paths to the folders shared with your download client. The game
   library is mounted at `/data` inside the container; add a matching entry under **Settings → Path Mappings**
   when the download client reports a different path.
4. Apply, then open `http://<unraid-host>:5000` to access the UI.

</details>

### CasaOS

<details>
<summary><b>Install via Custom Install (AppFile)</b></summary>

1. Open the **App Store** and click **Custom Install**.
2. Click the **import** icon (top right) and paste this URL:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG/main/casaos/docker-compose.yml`
3. Review the mounts — by default `/DATA/AppData/questarr` holds Questarr's data and
   `/DATA/Downloads` is mounted at `/data` so Questarr can import finished downloads. If you keep
   that second mount, add a matching entry under **Settings → Path Mappings**.
4. Click **Install**, then open Questarr from the CasaOS dashboard (port `5000`).

</details>

### Umbrel

<details>
<summary><b>Install via Community App Store</b></summary>

1. In umbrelOS, open the **App Store**.
2. Click the **⋮** menu (top right) → **Community App Stores**.
3. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG`
4. Open the **Snapetech** store and install **QuestarrNG** (app ID `doezer-questarr`, retained for existing installs), then open it from
   your dashboard (`http://umbrel.local:5000`).

</details>

### Cosmos Cloud

<details>
<summary><b>Install as a ServApp</b></summary>

1. Open **Market Place → Custom Install** (or **Servapps → Add**).
2. Paste this URL:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG/main/cosmos/questarr.cosmos-compose.json`
3. Fill in the install form: **Data folder**, optional **Library folder** (the root your download
   client writes into, mounted at `/data`), and `PUID`/`PGID`.
4. Install. Cosmos creates the route `questarr.<your-server-hostname>` and handles HTTPS for you.

</details>

### Kubernetes (Helm)

<details>
<summary><b>Install with the bundled Helm chart</b></summary>

A Helm chart lives in [`charts/questarr`](charts/questarr). It is not published to a Helm
repository yet, so install it from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG.git
cd QuestarrNG
helm install questarr charts/questarr --namespace questarr --create-namespace
```

Then port-forward (or enable the Ingress) and open the UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n questarr svc/questarr 5000:5000
```

Questarr keeps its state in a single SQLite database on a ReadWriteOnce volume, so the
chart never runs more than one replica. See [`charts/questarr/README.md`](charts/questarr/README.md)
for the full option reference — persistence, media mounts, secrets, Ingress and
subdirectory deployments.

</details>

### Home Assistant Add-on

<details>
<summary><b>Install as a Home Assistant add-on</b></summary>

You can install Questarr as a Home Assistant add-on from this repository:

1. In Home Assistant, open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Click the menu (⋮) and choose **Repositories**.
3. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG`
4. Install the **Questarr** add-on and start it.
5. Open `http://<home-assistant-host>:5000` to access the UI.

</details>

All platform definitions live in the repository and share the same mounts and ports — see
[docs/HOME_SERVER_APPS.md](docs/HOME_SERVER_APPS.md) for details.

- **APIs**: IGDB (game metadata), Torznab/Newznab (indexer search), PCGamingWiki, NexusMods, xREL.to
- **AIs usage**:
  - Claude and Github Copilot are used for AI-Assisted coding, internal code reviews, PR cleanup. Eventually automated coding and troubleshooting for small tasks and bug reports.
  - Gemini & Codex are used for automated code reviews, and brainstorming from time to time (as well as Perplexity for this usage).
  - Google Jules is used for light periodical refactoring.

## Configuration

1. **First-time setup:**

- Create your admin account
- Configure the IGDB credentials

Once logged-in:

- Configure indexers
- Add downloaders
- Add games!

See the upstream [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/Doezer/Questarr/wiki/Configuring-the-application#configure-app-behavior-in-settings--general) for more detailed info.

<details>
<summary><b>Getting IGDB API Credentials</b></summary>

IGDB provides game metadata (covers, descriptions, ratings, release dates, etc.).

1. Go to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
2. Log in with your Twitch account (create one if needed)
3. Click "Register Your Application"
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Questarr (or any name)
   - **OAuth Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost` (not used, but required)
   - **Category**: Application Integration
5. Click "Create"
6. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. Add them to your `.env` file

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Upgrading from v1.0 (PostgreSQL)</b></summary>

If you are upgrading from an older version that used PostgreSQL, you need to migrate your data.

The migration tooling was removed in v1.5.0 and is now run from the archived
**v1.4.2** release. Follow [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md), which inlines
the pinned compose file and links the sources by tag permalink.

> This is only for **pre-v1.1 PostgreSQL** installations. Running Questarr _on_
> PostgreSQL as an opt-in backend is a separate feature — see
> `docs/DATABASE.md`.

See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced usage</b></summary>

### Docker compose

This is mainly for users who want the latest commit (e.g when trying out fixes for an issue) or contributing users.

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snapetech/QuestarrNG.git
cd QuestarrNG
```

1. **Configure the application:**
   Edit `docker-compose.yml` directly if you need to setup a specific environment.

1. **Build and start the containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

1. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### Update to latest version for Docker

Your database content will be kept.

```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Reverse proxy / subdirectory deployment

Want to serve Questarr from a path like `https://xxx.domain.com/Questarr`
instead of its own subdomain? Set `QUESTARR_BASE_PATH=/Questarr` on the
container (or in `.env` for npm installs) and point your reverse proxy at it
— no rebuild required. See [docs/REVERSE_PROXY.md](docs/REVERSE_PROXY.md) for
full setup instructions (nginx, Traefik, Caddy).

</details>

## Roadmap

Based on the [Product Requirements Document](docs/PRD.md), here's what's planned over the next 6 months, in priority order:

- ✅ **P0 — Post-Processing Pipeline** : Move/copy completed downloads to a destination path, extract archives — closing the "set it and forget it" loop.
- **P1 — Smart Game Backlog**: Track the version of each downloaded game and notify (or auto-download) when a newer release shows up on indexers.
- **P2 — Direct Download Support**: Add debrid services (Real-Debrid and similar) as a downloader option, no seeding required.
- **P3 — External Library Sync**: Import owned games from Steam/GOG libraries and local filesystem scans, not just wishlists.
- **P4 — Integrations with External Tools**: ✅ Playnite extension shipped (library sync, request-to-download); RomM, Gameyfin, and a generic webhook for anything not explicitly supported are still planned.
- **P5 — Indexer Page Links**: A "View on indexer" link on search results and downloads.
- **P6 — PostgreSQL Support**: Re-introduce PostgreSQL as an optional backend, with SQLite remaining the zero-config default.

**Ongoing:** mobile responsiveness, search UX, performance, and security improvements.

See the full [PRD](docs/PRD.md) for problem statements, detailed scope, and non-goals.
